Retrieves the OMT/iMediaTouch OnAir xml file and displays the active cut.

== Description ==

This WordPress widget will display what automation (OMT iMediaTouch) is reporting as "playing",
or if nothing is playing, it displays 'Live DJ' or some other text.

It's a configurable plugin: You can change the title, the default program (currently 'Live DJ') which
displays when nothing is 'playing', and the location of the callsign_band.xml file generated by
iMediaTouch On Air (which of course you must have turned on.)

If your WordPress is hosted on the same system as the xml file, you can tell it to grab the file
directly, otherwise you specify the URL and it is retrieved.

You can also turn on (or off) the use of ajax, which when on, will update the xml file and display
every two minutes.

The output can be generated as an unnumbered list or plain.

Additionally, you may specify an optional footer to output below the on air data.
Commonly used to include a request line phone number.

== Installation ==

Install into /wp-content/plugins/lrhomtonair directory.

Go to dashboard and drop widget on sidebar of choice.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use FILE:// as the xml location? =

Yes, when your OnAir xml file is on the WordPress host site.

= Where is the WUMD OMT XML file? =

Use: http://lectriclar.net/wumdprod1/onair/wumd_fm.xml

= How do I turn on the xml file generation in OMT iMediatouch On Air? =

See the On-Air Workstation section on the iMediatouch On Air Users Manual.
